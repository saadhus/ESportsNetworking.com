					<p>E-Sports, or electronic sports, is the competitive play of video games via consoles, desktops, laptops, mobiles or other electronic devices. Fans all around the world gather at tournaments and online to watch their favorite professionals players go head to head. </p>
					<br>
					<p>Garnering an increasingly large audience, E-Sports has evolved from the rare annual competition that it was almost two decades ago to a warmly-embraced part of global culture. Hundreds of thousands of viewers and fans per event or cast is quite common but the fan base is always increasing at an exponential rate. </p>
					<!--<p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbspE-Sports, or electronic sports, is the competitive play of video games via consoles, desktops, laptops, mobiles or other electronic devices. Garnering an increasingly large audience, E-Sports has evolved from the rare annual competition that it was almost two decades ago to a warmly-embraced part of global culture. In the Southeast and East Asian region E-sports are regularly televised, and in some countries such as South Korea multiple TV channels are dedicated specifically to broadcasting E-Sports. In many European countries E-Sports are accepted as a part of daily life, which is attested to by the increasingly popularity of European gaming leagues and the incorporation of E-Sports in popular media.

					<div id="demo" class="collapse out"> <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFinally, our home country America has been a leading nation in the advancement of the popularity of E-Sports and E-Sports tournaments. Ever since the birth of E-sports, America has been the host country of many major gaming tournaments from one of the very first 1995 E-Sports tournaments in Richmond, Virginia to the countless tournaments hosted in the United States every year. Video gaming consumption has reached over 25 billion US dollars with more than 200 million players. More video games and gaming tournaments are being developed in the United States than ever before, and E-Sports, which has already become integrated into American culture, is only growing.
<br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere at E-Sports Network, we see with the rising popularity of E-Sports  an increasingly large potential space for advertising and sponsorship. However, due to its being a new medium, the advertising space in E-Sports has been, for the most part, untapped and almost completely open.  Our mission, as E-Sports Network, is toestablish a foundation combining the E-Sports world and corporate America thereby increasing commercialization and revenue for all involved parties.<p></div>
